Value based AI
==============

This AI operates on multiple levels where higher levels try to kill enemies
while lower levels try to move the ship without being killed.


Über AI (TODO)
--------------

Used to identify good targets for the current friendly ship positions and
cluster those ships.


Cluster AI (TODO)
-----------------

Knows it's target and a group of friendly ships from the Über AI. Tries to
attack the enemy by coordinated shots -- meaning a couple of shots passing near
the enemy at roughly the same time so the enemy has a hard time to avoid being
shot.
